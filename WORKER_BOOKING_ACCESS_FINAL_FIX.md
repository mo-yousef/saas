# Worker Booking Access - Final Fix

## What We've Done

### 1. ✅ Created Worker-Specific Booking View
- **File**: `dashboard/page-worker-booking-single.php`
- **Purpose**: A dedicated booking view for workers that bypasses the complex permission logic
- **Features**:
  - Clean, professional design matching the dashboard
  - Shows all booking details (customer info, services, address, etc.)
  - Quick action buttons (call, email, directions)
  - Responsive design
  - Simple permission check (only assigned worker can view)

### 2. ✅ Fixed Booking Retrieval Logic
- **File**: `dashboard/page-my-assigned-bookings.php`
- **Fix**: Use business owner ID to fetch bookings (since bookings are stored under business owner's tenant)
- **Added**: Comprehensive debugging to track issues
- **Added**: Database-level verification to ensure booking exists

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Debugging
- **Added**: Detailed error logging to track permission issues
- **Added**: Database verification to check if bookings exist
- **Added**: Step-by-step permission checking logs

### 4. ✅ Created Test Tools
- **File**: `test-worker-booking-access-simple.php`
- **Purpose**: Simple test to verify worker can access their bookings
- **Features**: Step-by-step verification of worker setup and booking access

## How It Works Now

### Data Flow:
1. **Worker clicks booking** → `my-assigned-bookings/?action=view_booking&booking_id=123`
2. **System fetches booking** → Uses `$business_owner_id` to query database
3. **Permission check** → Verifies `assigned_staff_id` matches current worker
4. **Display booking** → Uses worker-specific view (`page-worker-booking-single.php`)

### Key Changes:
```php
// OLD (broken):
$booking_to_view = $bookings_manager->get_booking($single_booking_id, $current_staff_id);

// NEW (working):
$booking_to_view = $bookings_manager->get_booking($single_booking_id, $business_owner_id);
```

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Run the Test Script
1. Log in as a worker
2. Go to: `your-site.com/test-worker-booking-access-simple.php`
3. Check for ✅ green checkmarks
4. Click the test URL provided

### Step 2: Test Manual Access
1. Log in as a worker
2. Go to "My Assigned Bookings"
3. Click on any assigned booking
4. Should see the booking details page

### Step 3: Check Error Logs
If still having issues, check your error logs for messages starting with "NORDBOOKING:"

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting Permission Error:

#### Check 1: Worker Association
```php
// Run this in WordPress admin or debug script:
$worker_id = 123; // Replace with actual worker ID
$owner_id = \NORDBOOKING\Classes\Auth::get_business_owner_id_for_worker($worker_id);
echo "Worker {$worker_id} is associated with owner: " . ($owner_id ?? 'NONE');
```

#### Check 2: Booking Assignment
```php
// Check if booking is actually assigned to worker:
global $wpdb;
$booking_id = 456; // Replace with actual booking ID
$worker_id = 123;  // Replace with actual worker ID

$booking = $wpdb->get_row($wpdb->prepare(
    "SELECT * FROM wp_nordbooking_bookings WHERE booking_id = %d",
    $booking_id
), ARRAY_A);

echo "Booking {$booking_id} assigned_staff_id: " . ($booking['assigned_staff_id'] ?? 'NULL');
echo "Expected worker_id: {$worker_id}";
echo "Match: " . ((int)($booking['assigned_staff_id'] ?? 0) === $worker_id ? 'YES' : 'NO');
```

#### Check 3: Database Table
Verify the bookings table exists and has the correct structure:
```sql
DESCRIBE wp_nordbooking_bookings;
```
Should have columns: `booking_id`, `user_id`, `assigned_staff_id`, etc.

### Common Issues:

1. **Worker not associated with business owner**
   - Fix: Re-invite the worker or manually set the association

2. **Booking not assigned to worker**
   - Fix: Assign the booking to the worker in the business owner dashboard

3. **Database table missing or corrupted**
   - Fix: Reinstall/repair the plugin database tables

4. **Permission caching**
   - Fix: Clear all caches and try again

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `dashboard/page-worker-booking-single.php` - Worker-specific booking view
- `test-worker-booking-access-simple.php` - Testing tool
- `WORKER_BOOKING_ACCESS_FINAL_FIX.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
- `dashboard/page-my-assigned-bookings.php` - Fixed booking retrieval logic
- `dashboard/page-booking-single.php` - Added debugging (if still used)

## Security Notes

The fix maintains all security measures:
- Workers can only view bookings assigned to them
- Workers can only access bookings from their associated business owner
- No cross-tenant data access
- Proper permission validation at every step

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fix** using the steps above
2. **Check error logs** if issues persist
3. **Run the test script** to verify setup
4. **Contact support** if problems continue with the debug information

The worker booking access should now work correctly. If you're still having issues, please run the test script and share the results.
