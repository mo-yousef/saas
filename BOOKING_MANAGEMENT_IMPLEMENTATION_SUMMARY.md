# Booking Management Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Booking ID in Email Notifications
**Problem**: The booking confirmation emails were not including the customer booking management link because the `booking_id` was not being passed to the notification method.

**Solution**: 
- Added `'booking_id' => $new_booking_id` to the `$email_booking_details` array in `classes/Bookings.php`
- Updated the `send_booking_confirmation_customer` method in `classes/Notifications.php` to generate and include the management link

### 2. Missing Management Link in Booking Form Success Response
**Problem**: The booking form success message didn't show the management link to customers.

**Solution**:
- Updated the booking handler in `functions.php` to include `booking_management_link` in the success response
- Modified the JavaScript in `assets/js/booking-form-public.js` to display the management link when a booking is successfully created

### 3. Missing Management Link in Email Templates
**Problem**: The email sent to customers didn't include the booking management link.

**Solution**:
- Updated the `nordbooking_enhanced_send_emails` function in `functions.php` to include a styled management link section in customer emails

## How It Works Now

### 1. Booking Creation Process
1. Customer submits booking form
2. Booking is created in database
3. Unique secure token is generated using booking ID + customer email + WordPress salt
4. Management link is created: `/customer-booking-management/?token=SECURE_TOKEN`
5. Link is included in:
   - Booking confirmation email
   - Success message on booking form
   - AJAX response data

### 2. Customer Access
1. Customer receives email with management link
2. Clicks link to access secure booking management page
3. Token is verified against booking data
4. Customer can view booking details and make changes

### 3. Making Changes
1. Customer selects reschedule or cancel
2. AJAX request sent with secure token
3. Server verifies token and updates booking
4. Business owner receives email notification
5. Dashboard is automatically updated

## Security Features

- **Token-based authentication**: SHA256 hash of booking_id + customer_email + wp_salt()
- **Timing-safe comparison**: Uses `hash_equals()` to prevent timing attacks
- **CSRF protection**: All forms use WordPress nonces
- **Input validation**: All user inputs are sanitized and validated
- **Status restrictions**: Only pending/confirmed bookings can be modified

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Booking Creation
1. Go to your booking form
2. Create a test booking
3. Check that the success message includes a "Manage Your Booking" link
4. Check your email for the booking confirmation with the management link

### 2. Test Management Functionality
1. Click the management link from email or success message
2. Verify booking details are displayed correctly
3. Test rescheduling to a new date/time
4. Test cancellation with optional reason
5. Verify business owner receives email notifications

### 3. Test Security
1. Try accessing the management page without a token (should show error)
2. Try using an invalid token (should show error)
3. Try accessing a cancelled booking (should show error)

## Troubleshooting

### If Management Links Don't Appear
1. Check that the booking was created successfully
2. Verify the `booking_id` is being passed to the notification method
3. Check WordPress error logs for any issues
4. Ensure the Bookings class is properly loaded

### If Routes Don't Work
1. Go to WordPress Admin > Settings > Permalinks
2. Click "Save Changes" to flush rewrite rules
3. Or run the `flush-rewrite-rules.php` script

### If Emails Don't Include Links
1. Check that the email template is loading correctly
2. Verify the `nordbooking_enhanced_send_emails` function is being called
3. Check email logs for delivery issues

## Next Steps

The customer booking management system is now fully implemented and should be working. Customers will receive management links in their booking confirmation emails and can use them to reschedule or cancel their bookings. All changes are automatically reflected in the business owner's dashboard with email notifications.

To further enhance the system, you could:
1. Add SMS notifications
2. Implement booking modification restrictions (e.g., no changes within 24 hours)
3. Add payment integration for cancellation fees
4. Create a customer portal with booking history
5. Add calendar integration for availability checking
