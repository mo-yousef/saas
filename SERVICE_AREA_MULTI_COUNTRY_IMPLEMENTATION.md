# Service Area Multi-Country Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds support for multiple countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland) to the Service Area feature. Users can select only one country at a time, and changing countries will display a confirmation popup warning that all previously selected cities will be removed.

## Key Features

### 1. Multi-Country Support
- **Countries Supported**: Sweden (SE), Norway (NO), Denmark (DK), Finland (FI)
- **Single Country Selection**: Users can only select one country at a time
- **Country Change Warning**: Confirmation popup when changing countries with existing selections

### 2. Scalable Architecture
- **Countries Configuration**: `data/countries-config.json` - Easy to add new countries
- **Service Areas Data**: Existing `data/service-areas-data.json` structure maintained
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing Swedish data continues to work

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Visual Country Selection**: Flag emojis and country names
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Custom modal for country change warnings
- **Real-time Updates**: Dynamic city loading based on country selection

## Files Modified/Created

### Configuration Files
- `data/countries-config.json` - Countries configuration with flags and metadata
- `data/sample-nordic-areas.json` - Sample data for testing other Nordic countries

### Backend Updates
- `classes/Areas.php` - Updated `get_countries()` method to use config file
- `classes/Areas.php` - Enhanced `get_service_coverage_grouped()` for country filtering
- `dashboard/page-areas.php` - Updated UI for country selection

### Frontend Updates
- `assets/js/enhanced-areas.js` - Added country selection and management
- `assets/js/service-area-selection.js` - Service area selection for service edit page
- `assets/js/country-change-dialog.js` - Custom confirmation dialog
- `assets/css/enhanced-areas.css` - Styles for countries grid and dialogs

### Service Integration
- `dashboard/page-service-edit.php` - Added service area section to service creation/editing

## Implementation Details

### Country Selection Flow
1. **Initial Load**: Display available countries from config file
2. **Country Selection**: User clicks on a country card
3. **Warning Check**: If user has existing selections in another country, show confirmation
4. **City Loading**: Load cities for selected country
5. **Area Management**: Standard area selection within chosen country

### Data Structure

#### Countries Config (`data/countries-config.json`)
```json
{
  "countries": [
    {
      "code": "SE",
      "name": "Sweden",
      "flag": "ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª",
      "default": true
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Service Areas Data (existing format maintained)
```json
[
  {
    "country_code": "SE",
    "zipcode": "186 00",
    "place": "Vallentuna",
    "state": "Stockholm",
    "state_code": "AB"
  }
]
```

### AJAX Endpoints
- `nordbooking_get_countries` - Fetch available countries
- `nordbooking_get_cities_for_country` - Fetch cities for selected country
- `nordbooking_get_service_coverage_grouped` - Enhanced with country filtering

### UI Components

#### Country Selection Grid
- Visual cards with flag emojis
- Hover effects and selection states
- Responsive grid layout

#### Confirmation Dialog
- Custom modal for country change warnings
- Clear messaging about data loss
- Confirm/Cancel actions

#### Service Area Integration
- Embedded in service edit page
- Real-time country and city selection
- Selected areas summary display

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators
1. **Adding New Countries**: Edit `data/countries-config.json` to add new countries
2. **Adding Area Data**: Extend `data/service-areas-data.json` with new country data
3. **Configuration**: No additional setup required - works with existing infrastructure

### For Users
1. **Service Areas Page**: Select country first, then manage cities within that country
2. **Service Creation**: Choose service areas during service creation/editing
3. **Country Changes**: Confirm when changing countries to avoid data loss

## Technical Notes

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing Swedish data continues to work without changes
- Previous service area selections remain intact
- No database schema changes required

### Performance Considerations
- Countries config cached in memory
- Lazy loading of cities based on country selection
- Efficient filtering in coverage queries

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback for missing country data
- User-friendly error messages
- Validation for country/city selections

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Multi-Country Services**: Allow services to span multiple countries
2. **Country-Specific Pricing**: Different pricing per country
3. **Localization**: Country-specific language support
4. **Advanced Filtering**: More sophisticated area selection tools

### Scalability
- Easy addition of new countries via config file
- Modular JavaScript architecture for extensions
- Flexible CSS grid system for different country counts

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Country Selection**: Verify all countries load and are selectable
2. **Change Warning**: Confirm popup appears when changing countries with selections
3. **Data Persistence**: Ensure selections are saved correctly per country
4. **Service Integration**: Test service area selection in service edit page
5. **Filtering**: Verify country filtering works in coverage display

### Sample Data
- `data/sample-nordic-areas.json` provides test data for Norway, Denmark, and Finland
- Can be merged with main data file for testing

## Deployment Notes

### Required Files
- Ensure all new JavaScript and CSS files are properly enqueued
- Verify countries config file is accessible
- Test AJAX endpoints are working

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers with ES6 support
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- Mobile-responsive design

This implementation provides a solid foundation for multi-country service area management while maintaining the existing functionality and user experience.
