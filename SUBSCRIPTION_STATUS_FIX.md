# NORDBOOKING Subscription Status Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. WordPress Localize Script Error ✅
**Error**: `Function WP_Scripts::localize was called incorrectly. The $l10n parameter must be an array.`

**Root Cause**: The `wp_localize_script` function was being called with a string value instead of an array for the `ajaxurl` parameter.

**Solution**: 
- Combined both localized variables into a single array
- Updated all JavaScript references to use `nordbooking_admin.ajaxurl` instead of global `ajaxurl`

**Files Modified**:
- `classes/Admin/ConsolidatedAdminPage.php` - Fixed localize script calls and JavaScript references

### 2. Subscription Status Inconsistency ✅
**Problem**: After successful Stripe payment, dashboard still showed "Trial" status instead of "Active"

**Root Causes**:
1. Webhook might not be called immediately after payment
2. No automatic sync mechanism between Stripe and local database
3. Success message showed before status was updated

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### A. Automatic Status Sync
- Enhanced `get_subscription_status()` method to automatically sync with Stripe when there's a discrepancy
- Added real-time status checking for users with Stripe subscription IDs
- Implemented automatic sync on success page redirect

#### B. Manual Refresh Mechanism
- Added "Refresh Status" button on subscription page
- Created AJAX handler `nordbooking_sync_subscription_status` for manual sync
- Added automatic sync trigger in sidebar when user returns from successful payment

#### C. Improved Success Message Handling
- Success message now triggers immediate status sync
- Message text adapts based on actual subscription status after sync
- Added fallback message for cases where sync is still in progress

## New Features Added

### 1. Subscription Status Sync
**Function**: `\NORDBOOKING\Classes\Subscription::sync_subscription_status($user_id)`
- Manually syncs subscription status with Stripe
- Returns true/false for success/failure
- Handles API errors gracefully

### 2. Stripe Status Mapping
**Function**: `map_stripe_status($stripe_status)`

### 3. AJAX Status Sync Handler
**Action**: `nordbooking_sync_subscription_status`
- Allows frontend to trigger status sync
- Returns updated status information
- Includes proper nonce verification

### 4. Auto-Sync Triggers

## Testing the Fix

### Test Scenario 1: New Subscription
1. Create new business owner account
2. Complete Stripe checkout with test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`
3. Return to dashboard - should show "Active" status immediately
4. If still shows "Trial", click "Refresh Status" button

### Test Scenario 2: Manual Sync
1. Go to subscription management page
2. Click "Refresh Status" button
3. Status should sync with current Stripe status
4. Page reloads with updated information

### Test Scenario 3: Admin Panel
1. Go to NORDBOOKING Admin → Subscription Management
2. No more jQuery errors in console
3. All subscriptions load properly including test ones
4. Statistics show correct counts

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console
- [ ] No WordPress PHP notices about wp_localize_script
- [ ] Subscription status updates immediately after payment
- [ ] "Refresh Status" button works correctly
- [ ] Admin subscription management loads all subscriptions
- [ ] Success messages are accurate and helpful
- [ ] Sidebar shows correct subscription status
- [ ] Test payments reflect proper status changes

## Troubleshooting

### If status still shows as "Trial" after payment:
1. Click "Refresh Status" button on subscription page
2. Check Stripe Dashboard to confirm subscription is active
3. Verify webhook URL is accessible: `yourdomain.com/stripe-webhook/`
4. Check WordPress error logs for webhook errors

### If refresh button doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify user is logged in and has proper permissions
3. Check that Stripe is properly configured
4. Ensure subscription has a Stripe subscription ID

### If admin panel still has issues:
1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Check for plugin conflicts
3. Verify all files were updated correctly
4. Check WordPress debug logs for PHP errors

## Benefits of This Fix

1. **Real-time Accuracy**: Subscription status is always current with Stripe
2. **User Experience**: Clear feedback and ability to manually refresh
3. **Admin Reliability**: Consistent data across user and admin interfaces
4. **Error Prevention**: Proper WordPress coding standards followed
5. **Debugging Tools**: Manual sync allows troubleshooting status issues

The fix ensures that subscription status is consistent and accurate across all parts of the system, with both automatic and manual sync capabilities to handle any edge cases.
