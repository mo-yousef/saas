# Final AJAX Registration Fixes

## Problem Identified
The registration was working (user created and logged in) but returning HTML instead of JSON, causing a parsing error. This was due to:

1. **WordPress hooks outputting HTML** after `wp_login` action
2. **Multiple wp_die() calls** - `wp_send_json_*` functions call `wp_die()` internally
3. **Output from other plugins/theme functions** during user creation process

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Output Buffer Management
```php
// Start output buffering before wp_login action to catch any output
ob_start();
do_action('wp_login', $user->user_login, $user);
ob_end_clean(); // Discard any output from wp_login hooks

// Clean output from subscription creation
ob_start();
Subscription::create_trial_subscription($user_id);
ob_end_clean();

// Clean output from email sending
ob_start();
$this->send_welcome_email($user_id, $display_name);
ob_end_clean();

// Final cleanup of any remaining output
while (ob_get_level()) {
    ob_end_clean();
}
```

### 2. Removed Redundant wp_die() Calls
- `wp_send_json_success()` and `wp_send_json_error()` call `wp_die()` internally
- Removed manual `wp_die()` calls that were causing issues
- Used `return` statements instead after JSON responses

### 3. Comprehensive Output Cleaning
```php
// Clean any output that might have been generated
if (ob_get_level()) {
    ob_clean();
}
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was that WordPress hooks and actions were generating HTML output during the registration process:

1. **wp_login action** - Other plugins/themes hooking into this were outputting HTML
2. **Subscription creation** - May have triggered database queries with debug output
3. **Email sending** - Could have generated output from email templates or SMTP debugging
4. **Theme/plugin conflicts** - Other code running during user creation

## Testing Tools Created

### `test-ajax-clean.php`
- Tests AJAX endpoints in isolation
- Shows raw response vs parsed JSON
- Helps identify where HTML output is coming from

### Usage:
```
http://yoursite.com/test-ajax-clean.php?test=company_validation&company_name=Test%20Company
```

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
1. ✅ Registration completes successfully
2. ✅ User is created and logged in
3. ✅ Clean JSON response is returned
4. ✅ No more parsing errors in frontend
5. ✅ Company name validation works properly

## Key Changes Summary

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| wp_login output | Uncontrolled | Buffered and discarded |
| JSON response | Mixed with HTML | Clean JSON only |
| wp_die() calls | Multiple/redundant | Proper single calls |
| Error handling | Basic | Comprehensive with cleanup |
| Output management | None | Multi-level buffering |

## Verification Steps

1. **Test Registration Form:**
   - Fill out registration form
   - Check browser console - should show clean JSON response
   - Verify user is created and logged in
   - No more parsing errors

2. **Test Company Validation:**
   - Enter company name in registration form
   - Check validation response in network tab
   - Should return clean JSON with validation result

3. **Check Error Logs:**
   - Look for "NORDBOOKING:" prefixed entries
   - Verify no PHP errors or warnings
   - Confirm registration process completes successfully

## Production Considerations

For production environments, consider:
1. **Remove debug information** from error responses
2. **Add rate limiting** for company name validation
3. **Monitor error logs** for any remaining issues
4. **Test with various plugins** to ensure compatibility

The registration should now work smoothly with proper JSON responses and no parsing errors.
