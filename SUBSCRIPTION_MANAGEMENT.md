# Subscription Management System

## Overview
The NORDBOOKING theme now includes a comprehensive subscription management system that allows users to view and manage their subscriptions directly from the dashboard.

## Features

### Dashboard Sidebar
- **Fixed Subscription Section**: Moved from a standalone box to a proper navigation item under "Account"
- **Status Indicators**: Shows warning badges for trial accounts with 3 or fewer days remaining, and danger badges for expired/unsubscribed accounts
- **Clean Navigation**: Integrated seamlessly with the existing dashboard navigation structure

### Subscription Page (`/dashboard/subscription/`)
- **Current Subscription Status**: Displays subscription status, days remaining, start date, and next payment date
- **Subscription Actions**: Context-aware actions based on current status:
  - Subscribe Now (for unsubscribed users)
  - Upgrade Now (for trial users)
  - Manage Billing (for active subscribers)
  - Cancel Subscription (for active subscribers)
- **Account Information**: Shows account holder details and plan information
- **Feature List**: Comprehensive list of subscription benefits

### Status Types
- **Trial**: User is in trial period
- **Active**: User has an active paid subscription
- **Cancelled**: User cancelled but still has access until billing period ends
- **Expired**: Subscription has expired
- **Expired Trial**: Trial period has ended
- **Unsubscribed**: User has no subscription

4. Manage billing and subscription settings

### For Developers
The subscription system integrates with the existing NORDBOOKING architecture:
- Uses existing Auth capabilities for access control
- Follows established CSS design patterns
- Integrates with existing AJAX infrastructure
- Maintains responsive design principles

## Customization

### Adding New Features
To add new subscription features:
1. Update the features grid in `dashboard/page-subscription.php`
2. Add corresponding CSS in `assets/css/subscription-page.css`

### Modifying Status Logic
Subscription status logic is handled in `classes/Subscription.php`:
- `get_subscription_status()` - Determines current status
- `get_days_until_next_payment()` - Calculates remaining days

### Styling
The subscription page follows the established design system:
- Uses CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Responsive grid layouts
- Consistent button and card styling
- Smooth animations and transitions

## Integration with Stripe
The system is designed to work with Stripe for payment processing:
- Checkout session creation
- Webhook handling for subscription updates
- Customer portal integration (placeholder implemented)

## Security
- All AJAX requests use WordPress nonces
- User authentication required for all subscription actions
- Proper capability checks for dashboard access
