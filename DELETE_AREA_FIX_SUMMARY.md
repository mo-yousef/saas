# Delete Area Functionality Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
**Error**: `{success: false, data: {message: "City code is required."}}`
**Root Cause**: Multiple issues in the delete area functionality

## Problems Found & Fixed

### 1. JavaScript DOM Selector Issue
**Problem**: The `handleRemoveCity` function was looking for `.coverage-city-item` class, but the new table design uses `.coverage-row` class.

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
const cityCode = $btn.closest(".coverage-city-item").data("city-code");

// After (correct)
const cityCode = $btn.closest(".coverage-row").data("city-code");
```

### 2. Backend Method Missing
**Problem**: The AJAX handler was calling `remove_city_coverage()` method that didn't exist.

**Fix Applied**: Created the missing method:
```php
public function remove_city_coverage($user_id, $city_code) {
    // Get all ZIP codes for the city from JSON data
    // Delete all matching areas from database
    // Return count of deleted areas
}
```

### 3. Updated Backend Handler
**Problem**: The backend handler was using old data structure and hardcoded country.

**Fix Applied**: Simplified the handler to use the new `remove_city_coverage()` method:
```php
public function handle_remove_city_coverage_ajax() {
    // Validate user and city_code
    $result = $this->remove_city_coverage($user_id, $city_code);
    // Return success/error response
}
```

### 4. Added Debugging
**Enhancement**: Added console logging to help troubleshoot future issues:
```javascript
console.log('Remove city clicked:', { cityCode, cityName });
console.log('Sending AJAX request to remove city:', cityCode);
```

## Technical Details

### Frontend Changes (`assets/js/enhanced-areas.js`)
- Fixed DOM selector from `.coverage-city-item` to `.coverage-row`
- Added validation to check if cityCode exists before proceeding
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting
- Improved error handling with user-friendly messages

### Backend Changes (`classes/Areas.php`)
- Created new `remove_city_coverage($user_id, $city_code)` method
- Updated `handle_remove_city_coverage_ajax()` to use new method
- Improved error handling with proper WP_Error responses
- Works with new multi-country JSON data structure

### Data Flow
1. **User clicks "Remove" button** on a city row
2. **JavaScript extracts city code** from `data-city-code` attribute
3. **Validation checks** ensure city code exists
4. **Confirmation dialog** asks user to confirm deletion
5. **AJAX request** sent to backend with city code
6. **Backend validates** user permissions and city code
7. **Database query** removes all ZIP codes for that city
8. **Success response** returned with count of deleted areas
9. **UI updates** to remove the row and refresh data

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Click "Remove" button on any city row
- [ ] Verify confirmation dialog appears with correct city name
- [ ] Confirm deletion and verify success message
- [ ] Check that city row is removed from table
- [ ] Verify database records are actually deleted
- [ ] Test with different countries and cities

### Error Handling
- [ ] Test with invalid city codes
- [ ] Test with network errors
- [ ] Test with insufficient permissions
- [ ] Verify error messages are user-friendly

### Browser Console
- [ ] Check for debug logs showing city code extraction
- [ ] Verify AJAX request data is correct
- [ ] Ensure no JavaScript errors occur

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. **Remove Button Click**: Should extract city code correctly from table row
2. **Confirmation Dialog**: Should show city name and ask for confirmation
3. **AJAX Request**: Should send correct city_code parameter
4. **Backend Processing**: Should find and delete all areas for the city
5. **Success Response**: Should return count of deleted areas
6. **UI Update**: Should remove row and show success message

The delete functionality should now work correctly for all cities across all supported countries.
