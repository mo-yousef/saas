# Invoice List Feature Documentation

## Overview

The Invoice List feature provides comprehensive invoice management for NORDBOOKING subscriptions, allowing both customers and administrators to view, download, and manage Stripe invoices.

## Features Implemented

### Frontend (Customer-facing)

1. **Subscription Page Invoice List**
   - Location: `/dashboard/subscription` page
   - Displays all paid invoices for the logged-in customer
   - Shows invoice number, amount, date, and billing period
   - Provides direct download links for PDF invoices
   - Includes "View Online" links to Stripe-hosted invoice pages
   - Auto-refreshes invoice data
   - Only visible for active/trial subscribers

2. **Invoice Actions**
   - **Download PDF**: Direct link to Stripe-generated PDF
   - **View Online**: Opens Stripe-hosted invoice page in new tab
   - **Refresh**: Manual refresh of invoice list

### Backend (Admin-facing)

1. **Admin Dashboard Integration**
   - Added invoice statistics to main dashboard KPIs
   - Shows total invoices and total revenue
   - Integrated with existing subscription management

2. **Subscription Management**
   - "View Invoices" button for each customer in subscription table
   - Modal popup showing customer's invoice history
   - Same download and view functionality as frontend

3. **Invoice Statistics**
   - Total number of invoices
   - Total revenue across all customers
   - Monthly revenue tracking
   - Currency-aware formatting

## Technical Implementation

### Classes Created

1. **InvoiceManager** (`classes/InvoiceManager.php`)
   - Singleton pattern for consistent access
   - Handles Stripe API integration
   - Provides AJAX endpoints
   - Manages invoice data formatting
   - Includes security checks for invoice ownership

### AJAX Endpoints

1. **`nordbooking_get_invoices`**
   - Gets invoices for current logged-in user
   - Security: Nonce verification + user authentication

2. **`nordbooking_get_invoice_pdf`**
   - Gets PDF URL for specific invoice
   - Security: Ownership verification + nonce

3. **`nordbooking_admin_get_customer_invoices`**
   - Admin-only endpoint for viewing customer invoices
   - Security: Admin capability check + nonce

### Database Integration

- No additional database tables required
- Uses existing subscription data to link users to Stripe customers
- Fetches invoice data directly from Stripe API

### Security Features

1. **User Authentication**
   - Only logged-in users can access their invoices
   - Admin-only access for customer invoice viewing

2. **Invoice Ownership Verification**
   - Verifies user owns the requested invoice before providing access
   - Prevents unauthorized access to other customers' invoices

3. **Nonce Protection**
   - All AJAX requests protected with WordPress nonces
   - Prevents CSRF attacks
