## How to Fix Your Issues

### Step 1: Fix Missing Subscriptions
1. Access this URL in your browser (replace with your domain):
   ```
   https://yourdomain.com/wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/fix-missing-subscriptions.php
   ```
2. Make sure you're logged in as an administrator
3. The script will create missing subscription records for all business owners

### Step 2: Verify the Fix
1. Go to your WordPress admin
2. Navigate to **NORDBOOKING Admin** â†’ **Subscription Management** tab
3. Click the **Refresh** button
4. You should now see all subscriptions including test ones

### Step 3: Check Debug Information
The subscription management page now includes a debug section that shows:
- Whether the subscription table exists
- Total subscriptions vs total business owners
- Warnings if subscriptions are missing

## Testing Your Stripe Integration

### For Test Subscriptions:
1. Ensure Stripe is in test mode
2. Create a new business owner account
3. Complete the subscription process with test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. Check the subscription management page - it should appear immediately

### Stripe Test Cards:
- **Success**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **Declined**: 4000 0000 0000 0002
- **Requires Authentication**: 4000 0025 0000 3155

## Troubleshooting

### If subscriptions still don't show:
1. Check the debug information section
2. Verify Stripe webhook is properly configured
3. Check WordPress error logs for any PHP errors
4. Ensure the subscription table exists in your database

### If jQuery errors persist:
1. Check browser console for specific errors
2. Ensure no other plugins are conflicting with jQuery
3. Try deactivating other plugins temporarily

### Database Issues:
If you see database errors, the subscription table might need to be recreated:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS wp_nordbooking_subscriptions;
```
Then run the fix script again.
