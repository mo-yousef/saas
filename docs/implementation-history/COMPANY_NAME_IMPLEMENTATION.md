# Company Name Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of enhanced company name handling during account creation, including proper validation, automatic settings population, and consistent display across the system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Company Name Validation (`classes/Auth.php`)

#### New Method: `get_user_id_by_company_name()`
- Checks for exact company name matches in both user meta (`nordbooking_company_name`) and settings table (`biz_name`)
- Prevents duplicate company names from being registered
- Returns user ID if company name exists, null otherwise

#### Updated Method: `handle_check_company_slug_exists_ajax()`
- Now checks for both exact company name matches AND slug conflicts
- Provides clear error messages when company names are taken
- Improved user experience with specific validation messages

#### Updated Method: `setup_new_business_owner()`
- Automatically saves company name to business settings (`biz_name`) during registration
- Ensures company name is available immediately after account creation
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing user meta storage

### 2. Enhanced Settings Initialization (`classes/Settings.php`)

#### Updated Method: `initialize_default_settings()`
- Automatically populates `biz_name` setting from `nordbooking_company_name` user meta
- Ensures company name is available in settings even for existing users
- Improves email template variable resolution

### 3. Improved Email System (`classes/Notifications.php`)

#### New Method: `get_business_name_for_user()`
- Centralized business name retrieval logic
- Checks settings first, then user meta, then display name, then site name
- Ensures consistent company name display across all emails

#### Updated Method: `send_invitation_email()`
- Now uses actual business name instead of site name
- Provides personalized invitation emails with correct company branding

#### Updated Business Name Resolution
- Fixed business name retrieval in booking confirmation emails
- Now properly checks both settings and user meta for company names

### 4. Consistent Display Implementation

#### Sidebar Display (`dashboard/sidebar.php`)
- Already properly configured to use `biz_name` setting
- Displays company name consistently in dashboard navigation

#### Invoice Generation (`includes/invoice-generator.php`, `invoice-standalone.php`)
- Already properly configured to use business settings
- Company name displays correctly on all PDF invoices and standalone invoices

## Validation Flow

### Registration Process
1. User enters company name in registration form
2. Frontend JavaScript validates company name on blur
3. AJAX call to `handle_check_company_slug_exists_ajax()` checks for duplicates
4. Backend validates both exact name matches and slug conflicts
5. If valid, registration proceeds with company name saved to both user meta and settings

### Error Messages
- **Exact match found**: "This company name is already taken. Please choose a different name."
- **Slug conflict**: "This company name would create a conflicting business URL. Please choose another."
- **Available**: "This company name looks available!"

## Database Storage

### User Meta
- Key: `nordbooking_company_name`
- Purpose: Backward compatibility and quick reference
- Saved during registration process

### Settings Table
- Key: `biz_name`
- Purpose: Primary business name for display and functionality
- Used by dashboard, emails, invoices, and all business operations

## Testing

### Test File: `test-company-name-validation.php`
Comprehensive test suite covering:
1. **Company Name Uniqueness**: Validates duplicate detection
2. **Settings Integration**: Ensures proper settings population
3. **Display Consistency**: Verifies correct name retrieval across components

3. **Bulk migration tool**: For existing installations to ensure all company names are in settings
4. **Advanced slug generation**: More sophisticated URL slug creation with better conflict resolution
