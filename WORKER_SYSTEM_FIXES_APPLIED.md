# NORDBOOKING Worker System Fixes Applied

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes applied to resolve issues with the Worker Management system, specifically addressing problems with "Invite New Worker via Email" and "Add Worker Directly" features.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Registration Flow Field Mismatch
**Issue**: The registration handler expected `role_to_assign` but the invitation form sent `assigned_role`.

**Fix Applied**: Updated the registration handler in `classes/Auth.php` to use the correct field name:
```php
// Changed from:
$is_invitation_flow = isset($_POST['inviter_id']) && isset($_POST['role_to_assign']);

// To:
$is_invitation_flow = isset($_POST['inviter_id']) && isset($_POST['assigned_role']);
```

### 2. JavaScript Form Validation Field Names
**Issue**: JavaScript validation was looking for incorrect field IDs.

**Fix Applied**: Updated `assets/js/dashboard-workers.js` to use correct field names:
```javascript
// Changed from:
var emailValue = $form.find("#invite_email").val();
var role = $form.find("#invite_role").val();

// To:
var emailValue = $form.find("#worker_email").val();
var role = $form.find("#worker_role").val();
```

### 3. Password Toggle Functionality
**Issue**: Password toggle buttons weren't working correctly.

**Fix Applied**: Enhanced password toggle functionality in `assets/js/dashboard-workers.js`:
```javascript
bindPasswordToggleEvents: function () {
  $(document).on("click", ".btn[data-target]", function (e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    var $toggle = $(this);
    var targetId = $toggle.data("target");
    var $input = $("#" + targetId);

    if ($input.attr("type") === "password") {
      $input.attr("type", "text");
      $toggle.find(".NORDBOOKING-eye-open").hide();
      $toggle.find(".NORDBOOKING-eye-closed").show();
    } else {
      $input.attr("type", "password");
      $toggle.find(".NORDBOOKING-eye-open").show();
      $toggle.find(".NORDBOOKING-eye-closed").hide();
    }
  });
}
```

Comprehensive test script to verify all worker management components are working correctly.

### 2. `debug-worker-system.php`
Debug script to help identify issues with the worker management system.

### 3. `fix-worker-system-complete.php`

## System Components Verified

### ✅ AJAX Handlers
- `handle_ajax_send_invitation` - Processes email invitations
- `handle_ajax_direct_add_staff` - Creates workers directly
- `handle_ajax_revoke_worker_access` - Removes worker access

### ✅ Email System
- `Notifications::send_invitation_email` - Sends invitation emails
- Email templates and styling
- Registration link generation

### ✅ User Roles and Permissions
- `nordbooking_business_owner` role
- `nordbooking_worker_staff` role
- `CAP_MANAGE_WORKERS` capability

### ✅ Database Integration
- User meta for owner associations
- Transient storage for invitations
- Proper cleanup on registration

## How to Test the Fixes

### 1. Test Email Invitations
1. Go to `/dashboard/workers/`
2. Click "Invite New Worker via Email"
3. Enter a valid email address
4. Select "Staff" role
5. Click "Send Invitation"
6. Check that success message appears
7. Verify email is received
8. Complete registration from email link

### 2. Test Direct Worker Creation
1. Go to `/dashboard/workers/`
2. Click "Add Worker Directly"
3. Fill in all required fields
4. Click "Create Worker Account"
5. Check that success message appears
6. Verify worker appears in workers list
7. Test worker can log in

### 3. Test Worker Access Management
1. View current workers list
2. Test editing worker details
3. Test revoking worker access
4. Verify revoked workers lose access

## Troubleshooting

### If Email Invitations Don't Work
1. Check WordPress email configuration
2. Install SMTP plugin if needed
3. Verify server can send emails
4. Check spam folders
5. Run `debug-worker-system.php` for diagnostics

### If Direct Creation Doesn't Work
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify form field names match handlers
3. Check server error logs
4. Verify user has correct permissions

### If Workers Can't Access Dashboard
1. Verify worker role assignment
2. Check owner association meta
3. Verify dashboard permission checks
4. Clear any caching

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Implemented
- Nonce verification for all forms
- Email validation and sanitization
- Role-based access control
- Secure token generation for invitations
- Input sanitization and validation

### ✅ Best Practices
- Invitation tokens expire after 7 days
- One-time use registration tokens
- Proper error handling without information disclosure
- Secure password requirements (minimum 8 characters)

## Performance Optimizations

### ✅ Implemented
- Efficient database queries
- Proper transient usage for invitations
- Minimal JavaScript footprint
- Optimized AJAX responses

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. Bulk worker invitation
2. Custom worker roles
3. Worker activity logging
4. Advanced permission granularity
5. Worker dashboard customization
