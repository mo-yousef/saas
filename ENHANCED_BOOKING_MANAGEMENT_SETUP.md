# Enhanced Booking Management Page - Setup Instructions

## üéØ What We've Accomplished

We've successfully refactored the booking single page to provide a modern, intuitive, and visually appealing experience. The new system redirects users from the dashboard "View Details" links to an enhanced customer booking management page.

## üîß Setup Steps Required

### ‚úÖ **SETUP COMPLETE!** 
The enhanced booking management system is now automatically activated! The rewrite rules are flushed automatically when you load any page.

### Step 1: Test the Integration
1. Go to your dashboard bookings page: `http://saas.local/dashboard/bookings/`
2. Click "View Details" on any booking
3. You'll be redirected to the enhanced customer booking management page with the new timeline and design!

### Step 2: Admin Notice (Optional)
If you see an admin notice in WordPress admin, you can click "Activate Enhanced Booking Page" to manually flush the rewrite rules.

## üöÄ How It Works

### Dashboard Integration
- When you click "View Details" in `/dashboard/bookings/`, the system:
  1. Retrieves the booking details
  2. Generates a secure token using the booking ID, customer email, and WordPress salt
  3. Redirects to `/customer-booking-management/?token=SECURE_TOKEN`

### Enhanced Page Features
- **Timeline Infographic**: Visual booking journey (Booked ‚Üí Confirmed ‚Üí Service Day)
- **Information Cards**: Color-coded cards for date/time, location, and pricing
- **Enhanced Sidebar**: Quick actions, invoice management, and support

## üîÑ URL Structure

### Old System

```
