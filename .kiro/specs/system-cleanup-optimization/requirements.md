# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on comprehensive system cleanup, performance optimization, and project organization for the booking management system. The system currently has numerous testing files, performance issues with dashboard loading, and lacks proper organization and secure configuration management. This cleanup will improve maintainability, performance, and security while ensuring clean GitHub deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all testing and debug files removed from the production codebase, so that the system is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is audited THEN all test-*.php files SHALL be identified and removed
2. WHEN the system is audited THEN all debug-*.php files SHALL be identified and removed  
3. WHEN the system is audited THEN all temporary development files SHALL be identified and removed
4. WHEN testing files are removed THEN the system SHALL continue to function without errors
5. WHEN cleanup is complete THEN no orphaned references to removed files SHALL exist

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want dashboard pages to load quickly and efficiently, so that I can work productively without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboard pages are accessed THEN they SHALL load within 2 seconds
2. WHEN performance bottlenecks are identified THEN they SHALL be documented and resolved
3. WHEN database queries are analyzed THEN inefficient queries SHALL be optimized
4. WHEN CSS and JavaScript are analyzed THEN unused code SHALL be removed or optimized
5. WHEN assets are loaded THEN they SHALL be minified and cached appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project files organized in a logical structure, so that the codebase is maintainable and easy to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project structure is reviewed THEN files SHALL be organized by functionality
2. WHEN similar files exist THEN they SHALL be consolidated or properly differentiated
3. WHEN directories are created THEN they SHALL follow consistent naming conventions
4. WHEN files are moved THEN all references SHALL be updated accordingly
5. WHEN organization is complete THEN the structure SHALL be documented

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all API keys and sensitive configuration stored securely in a dedicated configuration file, so that credentials are managed safely and consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API keys are identified THEN they SHALL be moved to a secure configuration file
2. WHEN configuration is centralized THEN it SHALL be easily accessible throughout the application
3. WHEN sensitive data is stored THEN it SHALL be excluded from version control
4. WHEN configuration is accessed THEN it SHALL use a consistent interface
5. WHEN environment variables are used THEN they SHALL be properly documented

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project to push cleanly to GitHub without issues, so that version control and deployment processes work smoothly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN .gitignore is reviewed THEN it SHALL exclude all sensitive and temporary files
2. WHEN the repository is prepared THEN all unnecessary files SHALL be excluded
3. WHEN Git status is checked THEN no sensitive files SHALL be staged
4. WHEN the project is pushed THEN it SHALL complete without errors
5. WHEN the repository is cloned THEN it SHALL work without additional manual setup
