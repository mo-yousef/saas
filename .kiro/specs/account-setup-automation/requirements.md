# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature automates the initial setup process for new user accounts by pre-populating demo services, setting default availability, creating sample discount codes, and configuring default booking form settings. This enhancement improves the user onboarding experience by providing immediate functionality and examples that users can modify or build upon.
