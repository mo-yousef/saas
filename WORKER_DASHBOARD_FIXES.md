# Worker Dashboard Fixes Applied

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes applied to ensure workers have a proper, restricted dashboard experience with only the necessary pages and consistent styling.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Worker Navigation Restrictions
**Problem**: Workers could see all business management pages including subscription, services, settings, etc.

**Solution**: Modified `dashboard/sidebar.php` to:
- Hide the entire "Business" section for workers (services, availability, discounts, areas, workers)
- Hide the entire "Settings" section for workers (booking form, settings)
- Hide the subscription status box for workers
- Workers now only see:
  - Overview
  - My Assigned Bookings

### 2. ✅ Worker Overview Widget Styling
**Problem**: Worker overview widgets used different CSS classes (`kpi-card`, `kpi-header`) than business owner widgets (`nordbooking-card`, `nordbooking-card-header`).

**Solution**: Updated `dashboard/page-overview.php` worker section to use consistent styling:
- Changed from `kpi-card` to `nordbooking-card`
- Changed from `kpi-header` to `nordbooking-card-header`
- Added proper `nordbooking-card-title-group` structure
- Added consistent `card-content-value` and description styling
- Updated the bookings list card to use `nordbooking-card` structure

### 3. ✅ Subscription Access Control
**Problem**: Workers could see subscription information that's not relevant to them.

**Solution**: 
- Workers inherit access through their business owner's subscription
- Subscription status box is now hidden for workers
- Workers don't need to manage subscriptions as they're covered under the owner's plan

## Files Modified

### 1. `dashboard/sidebar.php`
```php
// Added condition to hide business and settings sections for workers
<?php if (!current_user_can(\NORDBOOKING\Classes\Auth::ROLE_WORKER_STAFF)) : ?>
    // Business and Settings sections
<?php endif; ?>

// Added condition to hide subscription box for workers  
<?php if (!current_user_can(\NORDBOOKING\Classes\Auth::ROLE_WORKER_STAFF)) : ?>
    // Subscription status box
<?php endif; ?>
```

### 2. `dashboard/page-overview.php`
```php
// Updated worker widgets to use consistent classes
<div class="nordbooking-card">
    <div class="nordbooking-card-header">
        <div class="nordbooking-card-title-group">
            <span class="nordbooking-card-icon">...</span>
            <h3 class="nordbooking-card-title">...</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="nordbooking-card-content">
        <div class="card-content-value text-2xl font-bold">...</div>
        <p class="text-xs text-muted-foreground">...</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Worker Dashboard Structure

### ✅ Navigation Available to Workers:
1. **Overview** - Personal dashboard with assigned bookings stats
2. **My Assigned Bookings** - View and manage their assigned tasks

### ❌ Navigation Hidden from Workers:
1. **Bookings** (full business bookings)
2. **Calendar** (business calendar)
3. **Customers** (business customers)
4. **Services** (business services management)
5. **Availability** (business availability settings)
6. **Discounts** (business discounts)
7. **Service Areas** (business areas)
8. **Workers** (worker management)
9. **Booking Form** (form settings)
10. **Settings** (business settings)
11. **Subscription** (subscription management)

## Worker Overview Widgets

### ✅ Widgets Displayed:
1. **Your Upcoming Bookings** - Count of bookings assigned to the worker
2. **Completed Jobs (This Month)** - Count of jobs completed by the worker this month
3. **Your Upcoming Assigned Bookings** - List of upcoming bookings with details

### Widget Features:
- Consistent styling with business owner dashboard
- Proper responsive design
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Empty state handling
- Direct links to detailed views

## Access Control Logic

### Business Owner Access:
- Full access to all dashboard sections
- Can manage workers, services, settings
- Can view subscription and billing information
- Can access all business data

### Worker Access:
- Limited to personal assigned tasks
- Cannot manage business settings
- Cannot see other workers or business management
- Access controlled through business owner's subscription
- Can only view/manage their assigned bookings

## Security Considerations

### ✅ Implemented:
- Role-based navigation restrictions
- Capability-based access control
- Proper user role checking
- Data isolation (workers only see their assigned tasks)
- Subscription inheritance from business owner

### ✅ Benefits:
- Simplified worker experience
- Reduced confusion and clutter
- Better security through limited access
- Consistent user interface
- Clear role separation

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Worker cannot access business management pages
- [ ] Worker overview widgets display correctly with proper styling
- [ ] Worker widgets show accurate data (upcoming bookings, completed jobs)

### ✅ Business Owner Dashboard:

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Worker Notifications** - In-app notifications for new assignments
2. **Worker Performance Metrics** - Additional stats and performance tracking
3. **Worker Schedule View** - Calendar view of assigned bookings
4. **Worker Profile Management** - Allow workers to update their profiles
5. **Worker Communication** - Internal messaging system

## Conclusion

The worker dashboard now provides a clean, focused experience that:
- Shows only relevant information to workers
- Uses consistent styling throughout
- Maintains proper access control
- Provides a professional user experience
- Keeps workers focused on their assigned tasks

Workers can now efficiently manage their assigned bookings without being overwhelmed by business management features they don't need access to.
